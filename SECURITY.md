## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe that you have found a security vulnerability in our software, we ask that you report it responsibly. Please follow
guidelines below:

1. **How to Report:**
   - Send a detailed report to **security@ourproject.org** with the subject "Security Vulnerability Report".
   - Include a description of the vulnerability, the steps to reproduce it (if applicable), and any relevant logs or screenshots.
   - If possible, please provide us with a proof of concept or exploit code to assist our team in understanding and resolving the issue.

2. **What Happens Next:**
   - After receiving your report, our security team will acknowledge it within **48 hours**.
   - We will assess the severity of the vulnerability, and based on the findings, we will determine the appropriate action (patch, workaround, or denial).
   - For critical vulnerabilities, we aim to release a fix or mitigation within **7 days**.
   - We will provide regular updates on the status of your report during the resolution process.

3. **What to Expect:**
   - If your vulnerability is accepted, we will work diligently to address the issue and will communicate timelines for a fix.
   - If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide a clear explanation of why it does not meet our criteria for a security issue.
   - If your report leads to a fix, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability once the patch is released, with appropriate credit given to you if you choose to be acknowledged.

4. **Responsible Disclosure:**
   - We ask that you not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had an opportunity to review and address it.
   - We are committed to working with security researchers in a collaborative and respectful manner to ensure the security of our users.
